# Generated files by OpenDKIM (keys should ideally be managed securely, not committed)
# Consider if you really want to exclude them or handle secrets differently.
# For this academic project, excluding them from git and generating them during provisioning is fine.
# If you were to commit them, ensure the repo is private and be aware of risks.
